# noitamap-mod
Opens Noita Map at Player's Location

### Current Status
This is work in progress, currently pressing M opens a new browswer window with the correct URL, but it's being ignored by the map itself (fix is coming to the https://github.com/acidflow-noita/noitamap). Huge thanks to Horscht and Dexter for their help to fix the draft.
