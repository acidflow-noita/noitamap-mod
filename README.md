# NoitaMap mod

## What is this mod? Is it new? Do you like it?

This is a companion mod for the [NoitaMap](https://noitamap.com).

### Features

- When you press `M` on your keyboard, this mod opens the Noita Map in a new browser window, showing your current location in the game.
- Custom sound effects, which you can disable in the settings.

## How to use the mod
1. Download and uncompress [`noitamap.zip`](https://github.com/acidflow-noita/noitamap-mod/releases/download/1.0/noitamap.zip) and move the `noitamap` folder into the mods folder in Noita (Steam ➔ right click Noita ➔ Local files), or copy and paste the path into Windows Explorer:
```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Noita\mods
```
2. Launch Noita, click “Mods”, click “Unsafe mods: Disabled”, click “Yes” (this is due to deeper game integration requirements), click on “Noita Mmap” in the mods list so it shows `[x]`.

3. Press `M` mid-run to open the map at your current location.
4. This mod has options, adjust stuff to your needs.

## Supported game modes and custom mods

Works with:

- Regular game mod
- NG+
- Nightmare
- Apotheosis
- Noitavania
- Alternate Biomes

## When will you publish the mod on the Steam Workshop

I am unable to do so: NoitaMap mod requires elevated mod permissions (this is an "unsafe" mod). Unsafe mods are not allowed on the Workshop.

## Current status

I consider this to be the first stable relese (`1.0`).
