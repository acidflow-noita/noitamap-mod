# NoitaMap mod

## What is this mod? Is it new? Do you like it?

### Features

- Press `M` to open Noita Map in the browser at your current location in Noita.
- Custom sound effects, which you can disable in the settings.

## How to use the mod
1. Download and uncompress [`noitamap.zip`](https://github.com/acidflow-noita/noitamap-mod/releases/download/1.0/noitamap.zip) and move the `noitamap` folder into the mods folder in Noita (Steam –> right click Noita –> Local files), mine is located in 
```C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Noita\mods```
2. Launch Noita, click “Mods”, click “Unsafe mods: Disabled”, click “Yes” (this is due to deeper game integration requirements), click on “Noita Mmap” in the mods list so it shows `[x]`.
3. Press `M` mid-run to open the map at your current location (due to an unresolved bug with the map iteself it might not go to your precise location).
4. This mod has options, adjust stuff to your needs. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1d14e8e-b5da-47cd-8740-87d0b5a4faae)


## Supported game modes and custom mods

Works with:

- Regular game mod
- NG+
- Nightmare
- Apotheosis
- Noitavania
- Alternate Biomes

## When will you publish the mod on the Steam Workshop

I am unable to do so: NoitaMap mod requires elevated mod permissions (this is an "unsafe" mod). Unsafe mods are not allowed on the Workshop.

## Current status

I consider this to be the first stable relese (`1.0`), but **sometimes** the map itself ignores what the mod asks it to do (location is wrong).
I'm working on the fix for the [map](https://github.com/acidflow-noita/noitamap).
