# noitamap-mod

## What is this mod? Is it new? Do you like it?

Press `M` to open Noita Map at your location.

Works with:
- Regular game mod
- NG+
- Nightmare
- Apotheosis
- Noitavania
- Alternate Biomes

## When will you publish the mod on the Steam Workshop

I am unable to do so: NoitaMap mod requires elevated mod permissions (this is an "unsafe" mod). Unsafe mods are not allowed on the Workshop.

## Current status

I consider this to be the first stable relese (`1.0`), but **sometimes** the map itself ignores what the mod asks it to do (location is wrong).
I'm working on the fix for the [map](https://github.com/acidflow-noita/noitamap).

## Credits

Huge thanks to Horscht and Dexter for their help to fix the draft.
