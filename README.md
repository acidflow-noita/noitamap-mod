# noitamap-mod
Opens Noita Map at Player's Location

### Current issues
1) opening the browser (it either works with the default string "nollagames" dexter provided with his code snippet, or launches explorer)
2) debug print of the url im building shows empty message. am i wrong in the assumption that using setglobalvars is the way to go?
3) will the game mode / mod detection i've made work?
4) i still dont understand how to actually invoke launching the browser using the bind key from the settings -- key bindings and the settings are taken from infinitesunrise's implementation for noita together
